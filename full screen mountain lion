It would be wonderful if SimpleComic could, when in fullscreen using Mountain Lion for Mac, automatically become its own indendent desktop space.
With Mountain Lion, a full-screen window becomes its own space, and the desktop (and other opened full-screen windows) are accessible via a 4-finger trackpad swipe.
Comics stay open in the background and employers don't get angry!
